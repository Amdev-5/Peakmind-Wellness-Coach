## Project Structure

- `WellbeingCoachApp.py`: Main application file
- `knowledge_base.py`: Knowledge base content and management
- `vector_db.py`: Vector database management
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
- `.env`: Environment variables (create this file)

## RAG Pipeline

The application implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline:

1. User Query Input
   - User submits a question through the chat interface

2. Query Preprocessing
   - Question is analyzed for user profile updates
   - Semantic search query is prepared

3. Information Retrieval
   - Vector database is searched for relevant content
   - Top-k most similar documents are retrieved

4. Augmented Prompt Construction
   - Retrieved context is combined with system prompt
   - User profile information is included
   - Question is formatted for the model

5. LLM Call
   - Gemini Pro model generates response
   - Response is contextualized with retrieved information

6. Response Post-processing
   - Response is formatted for display
   - User profile is updated
   - Interaction is logged

## Knowledge Base

The knowledge base includes information about:
- Productivity techniques (Pomodoro, time blocking)
- Mindfulness and meditation
- Stress management
- Work-life balance
- Personal development

## Ethical Considerations

- The chatbot is designed to provide general wellness and productivity advice only
- It is not a replacement for professional medical or mental health services
- Users are advised to consult qualified professionals for serious concerns
- The system includes appropriate disclaimers and redirections
